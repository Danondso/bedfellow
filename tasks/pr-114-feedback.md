## Code Quality Issues

### 1.0 Fix danger-outline variant usage ✅

**Comment**: The 'danger-outline' variant is used but was added in the same PR. Consider ensuring this variant is properly tested and documented.
**Location**: src/screens/Settings/index.tsx:88

- [x] 1.1 Review danger-outline variant implementation
- [x] 1.2 Add tests for danger-outline variant (15 tests passing)
- [x] 1.3 Document the new variant in component documentation (README.md created)
- [x] 1.4 Verify variant works correctly in Settings screen

### 2.0 Remove duplicate scale transform in SampleCard ✅

**Comment**: The scale value 0.995 in the style duplicates the animated scale value, creating redundancy.
**Location**: src/screens/CurrentTrack/TrackList/SampleCard/index.tsx:50

- [x] 2.1 Review the duplicate scale transform
- [x] 2.2 Remove static transform from styles since animated transform overrides it
- [x] 2.3 Test card animations still work correctly

### 3.0 Clean up legacy isDynamicEnabled flag (Documented for future)

**Comment**: Mixing isDynamicEnabled boolean flag with ThemeMode.DYNAMIC enum creates complex logic. Consider deprecating the legacy flag.
**Location**: src/context/ThemeContext/index.tsx:139

- [x] 3.1 Review all uses of isDynamicEnabled flag
- [ ] 3.2 Migrate to using only ThemeMode.DYNAMIC (Future refactor)
- [ ] 3.3 Remove isDynamicEnabled from context (Future refactor)
- [ ] 3.4 Update all components using the legacy flag (Future refactor)
- [x] 3.5 Added TODO comment for future cleanup

### 4.0 Fix theme mode string comparison ✅

**Comment**: The theme mode comparison uses string literal 'dynamic' but should use ThemeMode.DYNAMIC enum.
**Location**: src/context/ThemeContext/dynamicTheme.tsx:27

- [x] 4.1 Review the string comparison issue
- [x] 4.2 Change 'dynamic' to ThemeMode.DYNAMIC
- [x] 4.3 Check for other string comparisons that should use enum (fixed both occurrences)
- [x] 4.4 Test dynamic theme still works correctly
