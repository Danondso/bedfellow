## Progress Summary

### Completed

- ✅ Replaced 1,747 lines of local Spotify types with npm package `@types/spotify-api`
- ✅ Updated all imports across 7 files to use the npm package
- ✅ Removed ImagePaletteContext and consolidated into ThemeContext
- ✅ Deleted old theme/styles and theme/index.ts files
- ✅ Removed 75+ console statements (replaced with error handling comments)
- ✅ Deleted all example and demo files
- ✅ Removed unused hooks and components
- ✅ Migrated components from old style system to new theme system
- ✅ Verified TypeScript compilation and linting passes

### Lines Removed So Far

- **1,747 lines** from `src/types/spotify-api.ts`
- **~500 lines** from ImagePaletteContext and useImagePalette
- **~300 lines** from old theme files (index.ts, styles/)
- **~250 lines** from unused hooks (useThemeMode.tsx)
- **~150 lines** from unused components (AppStartup.tsx)
- **~100 lines** from console statements and old style files
- **Total: ~3,050 lines removed**

### Phase 3 Component Consolidation Results

- **Created 420 lines** of shared utilities (will be reused across all components)
- **Reduced ThemedButton** by ~53 lines
- **Reduced ThemedView** by ~34 lines
- Net effect: Shared utilities will save more as remaining components are refactored

### Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 1 color consolidation
2. Target the theme system redundancy (8,554 lines of theme code)
3. Focus on high-impact consolidations first
